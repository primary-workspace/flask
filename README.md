# Car__Price_Prediction
A car price prediction project involves creating a model or system that predicts the price of a car based on various features. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a car given certain input characteristics like 'fuel type' , 'kms_driven', 'company name', 'name'.
The various steps involved in the code are:-
1. Data Colllection
2. Data Preprocessing
   1. Cleaning
   2. Encoding
3. Model Selection
   Linear Regression: A simple approach, assuming a linear relationship between features and the price.
4. Model Training and Evaluation
   training: Split the data into training and test sets, typically 80% for training and 20% for testing.
5. Tools and Libraries:
   Python Libraries:
    1. Pandas for data manipulation
    2. NumPy for numerical operations
    3. Scikit-learn for building machine learning models
    4. Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization   

Example Use Case:
A user wants to know the price of a "Maruti Suzuki Swift" of "maruti" with 100 kilometer driven, 2019 model, of "petrol" furl_type and a clean history. 
The model can take these features as input and output a predicted price.
